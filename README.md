# ODIN-Cryptography
To understand this  project we first need to be familiarized with some terms . . . . . . . 

Encryption: It is the methods by which information is converted into secret code that  hides the information’s true meaning. 

Decryption: The conversion of encrypted data into its original form is called decryption.  It is generally a reverse process of encryption. It decodes the encrypted information so  that an authorized user can only decrypt the data because decryption requires a secret  key or password. 

Brute force: It is a method in which one systematically checks all possible passwords and  passphrases until the correct one is found. 
Ciphers: A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption on some  information. A series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. 

We are starting off with few ciphers encryption and decryption and we expect this project to reach a point where it can be a comprehensive solution to every Ciphers known to people.

We have Successfully Created a small portion of the project where we can perform action with 3 known ciphers.
Caesar cipher(Encrypt/Decrypt/Bruteforce)
Morse cipher(Encrypt/Decrypt)
Vigenère cipher(Encrypt/Decrypt)

And we shall continue to add to the ciphers.
